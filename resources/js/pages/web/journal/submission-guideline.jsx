                Authors are required to submit their manuscripts through our
                official website by creating and registering an account. Upon
                registration, authors will gain access to their personal
                dashboard, where they can submit new manuscripts, monitor the
                review process, and track the status of their submissions. All
                manuscripts must be original, unpublished, and not under
                consideration elsewhere. Submissions should be prepared
                according to the journal’s formatting and referencing
                guidelines, which are available on the website. Authors are
                encouraged to carefully review and adhere to these guidelines to
                ensure a smooth review process. The journal follows a strict
                double-blind peer-review system, and all accepted articles will
                be published open access.

            <p>
                The purpose of this policy is to ensure academic integrity and
                maintain the quality of work published by DIT.ADS International
                Multidisciplinary Research Journal. Plagiarism is strictly

            <h1 className="font-semibold">Definition of Plagiarism</h1>
            <p>
                Plagiarism refers to the practice of using someone else's work,
                ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or
                permission. This includes, but is not limited to, copying text,
                ideas, or data without citation, paraphrasing others’ work
                without appropriate attribution, and submitting someone else’s
                work as one’s own.
