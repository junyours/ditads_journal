            <p>
                Plagiarism refers to the practice of using someone else's work,
                ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or
                permission. This includes, but is not limited to, copying text,
                ideas, or data without citation, paraphrasing others’ work
                without appropriate attribution, and submitting someone else’s
                work as one’s own.

                At DIT.ADS IMRJ, we strive to provide a transparent and

                Article Processing Charges (APC) Waiver/Discount Policy
            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>
                The purpose of this policy is to support students and
                early-career researchers by offering a waiver or discount on the
                Article Processing Charges (APC) for accepted manuscripts
                submitted to DIT.ADS IMRJ. We recognize that financial
                constraints can sometimes pose a barrier to publication, and we
                are committed to fostering inclusivity and accessibility in
                academic publishing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">Eligibility for Waiver/Discount:</h1>
            <p>
                The APC waiver or discount is available to students
                (undergraduate) who are the first author of the manuscript and
                are currently enrolled in a recognized academic institution.
                Early-career researchers who are in the early stages of their
                academic careers and who meet certain criteria may also be
                considered for a discount or waiver.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">Types of Waivers/Discounts:</h1>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">1. Full Waiver:</h1>
            <p>
                o A full waiver of the APC may be granted to students who are
                the first author and can demonstrate financial hardship or lack
                of funding opportunities for publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                o To apply for a full waiver, students must submit documentation
                (e.g., proof of enrollment, financial hardship statement) along
                with their manuscript submission.
            </p>
            <h1 className="font-semibold">2. Discounted APC:</h1>
            <p>
                o Students may be eligible for a 50% discount on the APC if they
                are the first author and their institution or research program
                does not provide funding for publication costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                o The discount will be applied to the standard APC fee of $130
                USD (or 7,000 PHP), bringing the cost down to $65 USD (or 3,500
                PHP) for eligible students.
            </p>
            <p>
                o Documentation confirming the student's status and lack of
                funding must be submitted for consideration.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">Application Process:</h1>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">1. Eligibility Confirmation:</h1>
            <p>
                o When submitting your manuscript, please indicate your student
                status and request the waiver or discount in your cover letter
                or submission form.
            </p>
            <p>
                o You will be asked to provide supporting documentation, such as
                a student ID, enrollment confirmation, or a letter explaining
                your financial need.
            </p>
            <h1 className="font-semibold">2. Review and Approval:</h1>
            <p>
                o Each waiver or discount request will be reviewed by the
                editorial team, who will assess the eligibility based on the
                provided documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                o You will be notified of the decision along with the outcome of
                the peer review process.
            </p>
            <h1 className="font-semibold">3. Payment:</h1>
            <p>
                o Once your article is accepted, and the waiver/discount has
                been approved, the adjusted APC amount will be communicated. The
                payment instructions will be sent to you once the final version
                of your manuscript is accepted for publication.
            </p>

                availability of funds.
            </p>
            <p>
                • The waiver/discount applies only to the Article Processing
                Charges (APC) and does not cover any additional costs, such as
                those for supplementary materials or special publication
                formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                • The waiver/discount is non-transferable and can only be
                applied to the manuscript for which it was requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                • Students who have received a waiver or discount may not be
                eligible for further reductions for future submissions to the
                journal.
            </p>

                We are committed to ensuring that financial barriers do not
