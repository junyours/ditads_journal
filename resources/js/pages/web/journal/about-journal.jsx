                    meaning that new issues are released four times a year. This
                    schedule ensures regular dissemination of research findings,
                    trends, and advancements in the field, while providing ample
                    time for peer review, editorial processes, and content
                    development. By adhering to a quarterly cycle, the journal

                <p className="text-sm text-justify">
                    Ideally, introductions should be brief. The following are
                    essential components of a strong introduction:
                    <br />
                    (1) a concise description of the problem that justifies the
                    work or the hypothesis that on which it is based.
                    <br />
                    (2) the problem statement that will be explored and tested.
                    <br />
                    (3) an explanation of the overall goals, objectives, and
                    strategy of the study. Exciting and engaging the reader
                    should be the goal of the introduction.

                    This section provides details regarding the materials,
                    methods, experimental design and other related information.
                    It is important to include enough information so that the
                    reader may replicate the tests. A chronological order, a
                    list of approaches, or any other arrangement that will best
                    help the reader can be used in this section.

                    To clearly convey the findings, use tables, graphs,
                    diagrams, and/or pictures. Significant findings should be
                    highlighted, but data from tables and visuals shouldn't be
                    covered in detail in the text. Demonstrate how the goals
                    were accomplished. The outcomes must be related to each
                    other. Labels for graphs, diagrams, pictures, and table
                    titles should be presented using APA format.

                    discussion section. Describe how the outcomes address the
                    issue that was mentioned in the introduction or as the goal.
                    Link this study's findings to earlier research to
                    demonstrate how and why they agree or differ. Indicate
                    potential future developments and highlight the work's
                    importance and ramifications. Avoid offering justifications
                    for unforeseen outcomes or experimental failures.
                    Discussions about contentious topics should be fair and
                    transparent. Results that deviate from earlier findings
                    should be explained.
