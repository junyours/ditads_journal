                The DIT.ADS International Multidisciplinary Research Journal
                (IMRJ) adheres to the highest standards of research ethics to
                maintain the integrity and credibility of published works.
                Authors, reviewers, and editors are expected to abide by the
                following ethical guidelines:
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">1. AI in Research</h1>
            <p>
                The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in research must
                comply with ethical standards to ensure transparency and
                reliability. Authors must disclose any use of AI in their
                research processes, particularly in data collection, analysis,
                or writing. AI tools should complement human expertise, not
                replace critical thinking, and must not be used to fabricate or
                falsify results. All AI-generated content should be properly
                attributed to avoid issues related to authorship and plagiarism.

                2. Ethical Treatment of Animals in Research
            </h1>
            <p>
                Research involving animals must adhere to ethical guidelines
                that prioritize their welfare. Researchers must ensure
                compliance with national and international animal welfare
                standards and acquire necessary ethical approvals from relevant
                institutions. The use of animals in research should be justified
                by clear scientific objectives, and researchers must minimize
                harm and suffering, applying the principles of the 3Rs: Replace,
                Reduce, Refine. All animal research should be clearly stated,
                with methods and protocols made transparent in the manuscript.
            </p>
            <h1 className="font-semibold">3. Authorship and Contributions</h1>
            <p>
                The authorship of a research paper should be based on
                substantial intellectual contributions to the research,
                including its conception, design, execution, analysis, and
                interpretation of results. All authors must be appropriately
                credited for their contributions, and no one should be included
                as an author who does not meet these criteria. Authors must
                ensure that there are no conflicts of interest and that all
                contributors have agreed to the final manuscript. Any disputes
                regarding authorship should be resolved before submission.
            </p>
            <h1 className="font-semibold">4. Plagiarism and Originality</h1>
            <p>
                Authors must submit original research and ensure proper citation
                of prior work. Plagiarism, whether intentional or unintentional,
                is strictly prohibited. Manuscripts should not contain text,
                data, or ideas derived from other sources without appropriate
                attribution. All sources used in the research should be
                acknowledged, and any instances of potential conflicts of
                interest must be disclosed.
            </p>
            <h1 className="font-semibold">5. Confidentiality</h1>
            <p>
                All data provided by participants in human or animal studies
                must be kept confidential and used only for the purposes of the
                research. Researchers should respect the privacy of participants
                and ensure informed consent is obtained before data collection
                begins. Confidential information should not be disclosed to
                unauthorized persons during or after the study.
            </p>

                By following these ethical guidelines, DIT.ADS IMRJ aims to
                foster responsible, transparent, and impactful research that
                adheres to the highest academic standards.
