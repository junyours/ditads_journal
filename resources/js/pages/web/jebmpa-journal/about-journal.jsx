                The publication frequency of this journal is quarterly, meaning
                that new issues are released four times a year. This schedule
                ensures regular dissemination of research findings, trends, and
                advancements in the field, while providing ample time for peer
                review, editorial processes, and content development. By
                adhering to a quarterly cycle, the journal maintains a balance
                between timely publication and high-quality, well-curated
                content.

            <h1 className="font-semibold">4. Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Ideally, introductions should be brief. The following components
                should be included:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. A concise description of the problem that justifies the work
                or the hypothesis upon which it is based.
            </p>
            <p>2. A statement of the problem to be explored and tested.</p>
            <p>
                3. An explanation of the overall goals, objectives, and strategy
                of the study. The introduction should engage the reader’s
                interest.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">5. Methodology</h1>
            <p>
                This section provides details regarding the materials, methods,
                experimental design, and any other related information. It is
                important to include enough detail so that the reader can
                replicate the study. The section can be organized in
                chronological order, by list of approaches, or any arrangement
                that will best help the reader.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">6. Results</h1>
            <p>
                To clearly convey the findings, use tables, graphs, diagrams,
                and/or pictures. Significant findings should be highlighted, but
                data from tables and visuals should not be covered in detail in
                the text. Demonstrate how the goals were accomplished. The
                outcomes must be related to each other. Labels for graphs,
                diagrams, pictures, and table titles should follow the APA
                format.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">7. Discussion</h1>
            <p>
                In the discussion section, evaluate the significance of the
                results. Describe how the outcomes address the issue mentioned
                in the introduction or as the goal. Link this study’s findings
                to earlier research to show how and why they agree or differ.
                Indicate potential future developments and highlight the work’s
                importance and implications. Avoid justifying unexpected
                outcomes or experimental failures. Discussions about contentious
                topics should be fair and transparent. Explain any findings that
                deviate from earlier research.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 className="font-semibold">8. Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                Identify major research findings with critical comments and
                comparisons to existing literature. This section should
                summarize all significant findings from the investigation.
                Ensure the reader does not misunderstand the results by stating
                these findings clearly. While conclusions are often included in
                the discussion section, it may be beneficial to present a
                summary of findings in a separate section for lengthy and
                complex papers.
