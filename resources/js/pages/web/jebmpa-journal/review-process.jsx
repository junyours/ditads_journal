                The DIT.ADS Journal of Economics, Business Management, and
                Public Administration follows a strict double-blind review
                process, ensuring that the identities of both authors and
                reviewers remain confidential throughout the evaluation.
                Submissions that do not meet the basic standards will be
                promptly rejected, and the authors will be notified of the
                decision.

                If a manuscript meets the initial criteria, the editors will
                assign two or more reviewers to conduct a detailed evaluation.
                Based on the reviewers’ feedback, the editors may recommend
                revisions before the article can be accepted for publication.
                Final acceptance is contingent upon the author making the
                necessary modifications in accordance with the reviewers’ and
                editors’ recommendations.
