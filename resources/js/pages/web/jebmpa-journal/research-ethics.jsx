                The DIT.ADS Journal of Economics, Business Management, and
                Public Administration adheres to the highest standards of
                research ethics to maintain the integrity and credibility of
                published works. Authors, reviewers, and editors are expected to
                follow the ethical guidelines outlined below:

            <br />
            <p>
                The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in research must
                comply with ethical standards to ensure transparency and
                reliability. Authors must disclose any use of AI in their
                research processes, particularly in data collection, analysis,
                or writing. AI tools should complement human expertise and not
                replace critical thinking. They must not be used to fabricate or
                falsify results. All AI-generated content should be properly
                attributed to avoid issues related to authorship and plagiarism.

                2. Ethical Treatment of Animals in Research
            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>
                Research involving animals must adhere to ethical guidelines
                that prioritize their welfare. Researchers must comply with
                national and international animal welfare standards and obtain
                the necessary ethical approvals from relevant institutions. The
                use of animals in research should be justified by clear
                scientific objectives, and researchers must minimize harm and
                suffering, following the principles of the 3Rs: Replace, Reduce,
                Refine. All animal research must be clearly stated, with methods
                and protocols made transparent in the manuscript.

            <p>
                The authorship of a research paper should be based on
                substantial intellectual contributions to the research,
                including its conception, design, execution, analysis, and
                interpretation of results. All authors must be appropriately
                credited for their contributions, and no one should be included
                as an author unless they meet these criteria. Authors must
                ensure that there are no conflicts of interest and that all
                contributors have agreed to the final manuscript. Any disputes
                regarding authorship should be resolved before submission.

            <h1 className="font-semibold">4. Plagiarism and Originality</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
                Authors must submit original research and ensure proper citation
                of prior work. Plagiarism, whether intentional or unintentional,
                is strictly prohibited. Manuscripts should not contain text,
                data, or ideas derived from other sources without appropriate
                attribution. All sources used in the research must be
                acknowledged, and any potential conflicts of interest must be
                disclosed.

                All data provided by participants in human or animal studies
                must be kept confidential and used solely for the purposes of
                the research. Researchers should respect the privacy of
                participants and ensure informed consent is obtained before data
                collection begins. Confidential information should not be
                disclosed to unauthorized persons during or after the study.
