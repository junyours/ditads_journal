                Authors are required to submit their manuscripts through our
                official website by creating and registering an account. Upon
                registration, authors will gain access to their personal
                dashboard, where they can submit new manuscripts, monitor the
                review process, and track the status of their submissions. All
                manuscripts must be original, unpublished, and not under
                consideration elsewhere. Submissions should be prepared
                according to the journal’s formatting and referencing
                guidelines, which are available on the website. Authors are
                encouraged to carefully review and adhere to these guidelines to
                ensure a smooth review process. The journal follows a strict
                double-blind peer-review system, and all accepted articles will
                be published open access.

            <br />
            <p>
                Plagiarism refers to the practice of using someone else's work,
                ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or
                permission. This includes, but is not limited to, copying text,
                ideas, or data without citation, paraphrasing others' work
                without appropriate attribution, and submitting someone else's
                work as one’s own.

                Manuscript Submission and Checking Process

            <p className="font-semibold">1. Initial Submission:</p>
            <p>
                o Authors submitting manuscripts must ensure that the content is
                original and properly cited. Any text, data, or ideas borrowed
                from other sources should be clearly referenced according to the
                publication's citation guidelines.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">2. Plagiarism Screening:</p>
            <p>
                o Upon receipt of a manuscript, it will undergo a plagiarism
                check using a reputable plagiarism detection tool (e.g.,
                Turnitin, iThenticate).
            </p>
            <p>
                o The manuscript will be assessed for similarity against
                published sources and other submitted papers within the
                database.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">3. Evaluation of Results:</p>
            <p>
                o If the plagiarism check reveals a similarity index above 20%,
                the manuscript will be reviewed further by the editorial team to
                determine the extent and context of the matches.
            </p>
            <p>
                o The editorial team will consider whether the similarities are
                properly cited, if they constitute an infringement on academic
                integrity, or if the work includes content that is excessively
                similar to other sources without sufficient originality or
                citation.

                o If plagiarism is found to be unintentional or minor (e.g.,
                improper citation or a small degree of overlap), the authors
                will be notified and given an opportunity to correct the
                manuscript by providing proper citations or making revisions.
            </p>

                o The manuscript may be sent back for revision and resubmission.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">2. Major Violations:</p>
            <p>
                o If the plagiarism is substantial or deliberate, the manuscript
                will be rejected, and the authors will be informed that their
                submission has been disqualified due to plagiarism.
            </p>
            <p>
                o Authors found to have committed serious plagiarism may be
                banned from submitting future manuscripts to DIT.ADS JEBMPA.

                published, the article will be retracted, and a notice of
                retraction will be published in the journal.

                review of the manuscript to assess its relevance to the
                journal's scope and quality.
            </p>
