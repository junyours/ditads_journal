                The official logo of zDitads. Magazine: Mindset | Mastery |
                Momentum is a powerful emblem that reflects the core identity
                and guiding principles of Zas Digital Institute Training and
                Development Services (DITADS) – Philippines.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                At the center of the logo stands the prominent green “Z”, which
                represents Zas and symbolizes growth, direction, and
                transformation. The bold and dynamic form of the “Z” also
                reflects forward movement—an allusion to progress, momentum, and
                continuous learning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Surrounding the “Z” are the three defining pillars of the
                magazine:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-semibold">• Mindset</span> – The
                foundation for purpose-driven living and success. It affirms
                that all growth begins with a renewed way of thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-semibold">• Mastery</span> – The pursuit
                of excellence in one’s personal and professional life,
                emphasizing discipline, skill, and lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-semibold">• Momentum</span> – The drive to
                move forward, overcome challenges, and create lasting impact
                through service and innovation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                These three concepts are aligned vertically around the “Z,”
                creating a balanced narrative of internal transformation,
                external excellence, and enduring impact.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The name DIT·ADS is placed below the emblem, reinforcing the
                identity of the parent institution behind the publication. The
                use of the red dot between “DIT” and “ADS” symbolizes focus,
                intentionality, and precision—traits essential in both education
                and leadership.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Encircling the emblem is the complete name:</p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-semibold">
                    ZAS DIGITAL INSTITUTE AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES
                </span>
                , in bold black, affirming the institutional authority and
                commitment behind the magazine. The words “ZAS” and “MAGAZINE”
                are emphasized in red to highlight both the brand origin and the
                nature of the platform as a formal, recurring publication.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The entire logo is framed within a circular badge—signifying
                unity, continuity, and wholeness, which aligns with the
                magazine’s mission to promote holistic development and
                collaborative impact.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Together, every element of the zDitads. Magazine logo tells a
                story—not just of a publication, but of a movement toward
                excellence, inspiration, and service.
